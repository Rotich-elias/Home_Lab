# Home_Lab
My self-hosted homelab setup documented with Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes experiments
# SmithHomeLab 🖥️

Welcome to my personal **homelab project**.  
This repo documents how I use **Smith PC** (main laptop) and **SmithLab** (server laptop) to learn DevOps, Fullstack, and Cloud tools.

## 🚀 Goals
- Learn and practice **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code
- Run **Docker containers** and experiment with services
- Explore **Kubernetes** and automation tools
- Build a self-hosted platform for development & testing

## 🏗️ Hardware
- **Smith PC**: Main laptop (controller, management, GitHub/IDE)
- **SmithLab**: Server laptop (hosts Docker, Terraform, and future Kubernetes)

## 📂 Repo Structure
- `docs/` → Guides and documentation
- `terraform/` → Terraform configs for provisioning
- `docker/` → Docker Compose files
- `screenshots/` → Setup visuals, dashboards, or architecture diagrams

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [x] Setup GitHub repo
- [ ] Install Terraform on SmithLab
- [ ] Deploy first Docker container
- [ ] Configure Terraform to manage SmithLab services
- [ ] Add Kubernetes later
